# ngx\_header\_path\_auth

**ngx\_header\_path\_auth** is a module for [nginx auth request module](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_auth_request_module.html) that authorizes with the user name and path information set in the HTTP header.

## Error handling

On error, the process terminates with an unsuccessful status. 

## How to start

Run it on the command line like this:

```
ngx_header_path_auth <config file>
```

Since it does not provide background execution functions such as daemonization,
start it via a process management system such as systemd.

## Configuration file format

See the [auth request module documentation](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_auth_request_module.html) for how to configure nginx.

The **ngx\_header\_path\_auth** configuration file is in TOML format, and the following is a sample configuration file.

```ini
socket_type = "tcp"
socket_path = "127.0.0.1:9202"
#cache_seconds = 0
path_header = "X-Authz-Path"
user_header = "X-Forwarded-User"

[authz]
user_map = "/etc/ngx_auth_mod/usermap.conf"

path_pattern = "^/([^/]+)/"
nomatch_right = "@admin"
default_right = "*/

[authz.path_right]
"test" = "@dev"
```

Each parameter of the configuration file is as follows.

### Root part

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **socket\_type** | Set this parameter to tcp(TCP socket) or unix(UNIX domain socket). |
| **socket\_path** | Set the IP address and port number for tcp, and UNIX domain socket file path for unix. |
| **cache\_seconds** | The cache duration in seconds to pass to nginx. However, if its value is 0, it will not use the cache.<br>See [Authentication Cache Control](proxy_cache.md) for details.|
| **path\_header** | A HTTP header that sets the path used for authorization processing. The default value is `X-Authz-Path`. In the appropriate place of the nginx configuration file, use `proxy_set_header` directive to set the HTTP header. (Eg `proxy_set_header X-Authz-Path $request_uri;`) |
| **user\_header** | A HTTP header to set the user name. The default value is `X-Forwarded-User`. In the appropriate place of the nginx configuration file, use `proxy_set_header` directive to set the HTTP header. (Eg `proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-User $remote_user;`) |

### **\[authz\]** part

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **user\_map\_config** | A file that specifies how user names and group names are handled in **user\_map**.  More on this in the "_**user\_map\_config** file details_" section. |
| **user_map** | User name and group name mapping file. More on this in the "_**user\_map** file details_" section. |
| **path\_pattern** | A regular expression that extracts the authorization judgment string from the path of the header specified by **path\_header**. The extracted string is used for the key in **path\_right**. Use the `()` subexpression regular expression only once to specify the extraction location. |
| **nomatch\_right** | Authorization rights when the **path\_pattern** regular expression is not matched. For more information on authorization rights, see "_Authorization rights details_" section. |
| **default\_right** | Authorization rights when it matches the **path\_pattern**„ÅÆ regular expression and is not specified in **path\_right**. For more information on authorization rights, see "_Authorization rights details_". |
| **path\_right** | Authorization rights map for each extracted string when matching **path\_pattern** regular expression. Specify the extraction string as the key. For more information on authorization rights, see "_Authorization rights details_" section. |

## Authorization rights details

In **\[authz\]** part, **nomatch\_right**, **default\_right**, and **path\_right** table value specify a character string that combines the following judgment descriptions with `|`. The combined judgment process is calculated by logical disjunction("OR"). If the result is true, it is authorized.

| Authorization method | Description|
| :--- | :--- |
| empty string | Always considers true regardless of the user name. |
| `!` | Always considers false regardless of the user name. |
| `*` | If the user name exists, it is considered true. |
| `@groupname` | The character string after @ is treated as a group name. True if the group contains users. Groups are defined in the **user_map** file. |
| `@` (no group name) | True if the user is described in the **user_map** file. |
| user name | True if the user name matches. |

## **user\_map\_config** file details

**user\_map\_config** is a file that defines the handling of user names and group names.   
This text file defines the available usernames and group names in regular expressions, as shown below.

```
user_regex = '^[a-z_][0-9a-z_\-]{0,32}$'
group_regex = '^[a-z_][0-9a-z_\-]{0,32}$'
```

| Parameter| Description|
| :--- | :--- |
| **user\_regex** | A regular expression of strings to allow as usernames. |
| **group\_regex** | Regular expression of strings to allow as group names. |
